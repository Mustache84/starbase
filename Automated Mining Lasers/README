This YOLOL is for automating a back/forth sweeping motion on the Buffalo's two preinstalled lasers with a few tweaks  
and timings, plus pulsing of the ore collectors and lasers for power saving. 

I recommend aiming dead center of the asteroid and with Turtle mode enabled, just roll your ship while you mine. It should shread the entire roid up to your basic t5/t6. 

*Naming*
Set your mining button top name to `Mine`
Set your Ore Collectors names to `CL`

*Naming plus turrent base config*
Set RIGHT TurretRotation field name to `RTY`
Set LEFT TurretRotation field name to to `LTY`
**If you installed a third laser on the bottom, named this one to `BTY`
Set the pitch on your turrets to however you want them pointing
Note that these are the top key:value pair

Install a second chip right below this chip in your rack
Add the code from Laser Automation to that 2nd chip
